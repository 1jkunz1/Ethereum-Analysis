<b> Conclusion </b>
 I love Vitalik and the whole Ethereum team - unfortunately I cannot see anyway to justify it's value. I don't believe it would be possible to scale a single production-level application without disrupting the entire network at this time. The system is very complex
 
 <b> I believe growth of network has occurred at an unhealthy rate. </b>
